# Fix for MySQL Connection Error

## Problem:
Railway is trying to connect to MySQL even though we switched to SQLite.

## Root Cause:
The old `production_settings.py` file had MySQL configuration and might have been used by Railway.

## Solution Applied:

### 1. Deleted production_settings.py
- ✅ Removed the file with MySQL configuration
- ✅ Now using main settings.py with SQLite

### 2. Verify Railway Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Railway Dashboard → Variables:

**REMOVE these if they exist:**
- ❌ `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` (delete this if present)
- ❌ `DATABASE_URL` (delete this if present)
- ❌ Any DB_* variables (DB_NAME, DB_USER, etc.)

**KEEP only these:**
```
SECRET_KEY=WWYdj4YNaKUwCod_DFwNraNZp14fNCg1Wz_GktsJq1fTvuB6u28HQW_fVDMvNkXxu9w
DEBUG=False
EMAIL_HOST_USER=dileeplekkala14@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=yrhhsukcqcogphgz
```

### 3. Force Railway to Rebuild
After removing the variables:
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to **Deployments** tab
4. Click **"Redeploy"** or trigger a new deployment

## How to Deploy the Fix:

```bash
cd main_project
git add .
git commit -m "Removed production_settings.py - using SQLite only"
git push origin main
```

## What Should Happen:

### During Build:
```
✓ Installing dependencies (no mysqlclient)
✓ Collecting static files
✓ Build completed
```

### During Startup:
```
✓ Running migrations (using SQLite)
✓ Starting gunicorn
✓ Listening on 0.0.0.0:PORT
✓ App is ready
```

## Verify SQLite is Being Used:

Once deployed, check the logs for:
```
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, ...
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  ...
```

If you see this, SQLite is working!

## If Still Getting MySQL Error:

### Check Railway Variables:
1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Variables
2. Look for any of these and DELETE them:
   - `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`

### Clear Railway Cache:
1. In Railway Dashboard
2. Settings → Danger Zone
3. Click "Clear Build Cache"
4. Redeploy

## Expected Result:

✅ No MySQL errors
✅ SQLite database created
✅ Migrations run successfully
✅ App starts without errors
✅ `/health/` endpoint returns 200 OK

## Timeline:

- **Push changes**: 1 minute
- **Railway rebuild**: 6-10 minutes
- **Total**: ~10 minutes

Your app should work after this fix!
